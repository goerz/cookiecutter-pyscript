cookiecutter-pyscript
=====================

A [cookiecutter][] template for a single Python console script based on the
[click][] library. The script will be pip-installable via setuptools
`entry_points`.

Usage
-----

First, make sure to have `cookiecutter` installed:

    pip install cookiecutter

Then, create a new project with

    git clone https://github.com/goerz/cookiecutter-pypscript.git
    cookiecutter cookiecutter-pypscript/

or

    cookiecutter gh:goerz/cookiecutter-pyscript

You should then change the classifiers in `{{ project_name }}/setup.py`. It is
assumed that the project will run on the latest versions of Python 2 and 3, so
you should remove any classifiers that do not apply. The full list of PyPI
classifiers can be found [here][classifiers]. The generated README file will be
very minimal, and you are encouraged to extend it.

[classifiers]: https://pypi.python.org/pypi?:action=list_classifiers

Variables
---------

* `author_name`: Full author name, will show up in README, in the module, and on PyPI
* `author_email` Author email address
* `project_name`: The name of the package on PyPI, also the name of the folder that will be generated
* `module_name`: Name of the python module that defines the command (without `.py` extension)
* `script_name`: Name of the script, as will be generated by `pip install`. That is, the command you will be able to run after installation.
* `version`: Initial version of the script
* `description`: (Short) description to appear as the doc-string of the module, in the documentation of the console script, in the README, and on PyPI
* `url`: The project URL (e.g., on Github)
* `year`: The copyright year
* `license`: The license under wich the code will be available (choice of MIT, GPL, or Public Domain)

Note that generally, `script_name` `module_name`, and `project_name` should be
the same, except possibly for the use of hyphens and underscores:
`script_name`/`project_name` should generally prefer hyphens over underscores,
whereas `module_name` must not contain hyphens.


Structure and Features
----------------------

Using `my_script` as the `module_name`, a project folder (with `project_name`)
will be created, containing the following files:

    .
    ├── LICENSE
    ├── Makefile
    ├── README.markdown
    ├── my_script.py
    └── setup.py


The project contains a single module, `my_script` in this example, whose `main`
function is set up as an entry-point in `setup.py`. The `Makefile` contains some
shortcuts for installing and uninstalling via `pip`, and for pushing to PyPI or
the PyPI test server.
